The 8th part! Getting close to the full finished project. Unfortunately, the CPU has again been updated after this.
What this part added, however, was the ability to jump and branch in our code! If you want to jump to the 3rd instruction,
you can! If you want to go back five instructions of one value is less than another, you can! Loops and jumps are now possible.
